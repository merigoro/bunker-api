# BUNKER API
Hello World

I created this project just for fun purposes and to learn all the new .NET 7 feauters. Having said that the application aims to find the closest fallout bunker to the searched location. I will continue to work on it to test the changes they make with the various versions of .NET and to continue learning while having fun. If you have any suggestions for me, create an issue.

You can find the GUI source code here https://github.com/merigoro/bunker-gui.

Peace
